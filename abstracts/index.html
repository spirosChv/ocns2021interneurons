	<p> Basket cells are key GABAergic inhibitory interneurons that target the somata and proximal dendrites, enabling efficient control of the timing and rate of
	spiking of their postsynaptic targets. In all cortical circuits, there are two major types of basket cell that exhibit striking developmental, molecular,
	anatomical, and physiological differences. In this talk, I will discuss recent results that reveal the tightly coupled complementarity of these two key
	microcircuit regulatory modules, demonstrating a novel form of brain-state-specific segregation of inhibition during spontaneous behavior, with implications
	for the assessment of dysregulated inhibition in neurological disorders. In addition, we will discuss recent experimental and computational modeling insights
	from a collaborative project with the <a style="color:blue" href="https://www.losonczylab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Losonczy lab</a>
	at Columbia that predict key roles for interneurons in the selective suppression of cue-responsive cells
	during hippocampal ripples related to episodic memory replay.

	<p> Electrophysiological recordings in the hippocampus have revealed a tight control of inhibitory interneurons over the Granule Cells (GCs) of the Dentate Gyrus 
		(DG).  In experiments of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) of the Perforant Pathway in vivo, we show that together with the expected potentiation of 
		glutamatergic synapses, a reduction of the feed-forward inhibitory activity also occurs, facilitating activity propagation in the circuit. To further 
		investigate this phenomenon, we built a population model where neurons were described by Izhikevich's  equations. The results obtained from the numerical 
		integration of the model equations, before and after LTP induction, support the counterintuitive experimental observation of synaptic depression in the 
		feed-forward inhibitory connection after LTP induction. We find that LTP increases the efficiency of the glutamatergic input to recruit the inhibitory 
		network of the hilar region, resulting in an average reduction of the basket cell population activity. The predictions of the model were supported by 
		electrophysiological recordings in mice, in an in vitro preparation of intracellular patch-clamp recordings after in vivo LTP induction. Our models 
		predict that the functional reorganization induced by LTP also improves the temporal coding of GCs and the information transmission from the entorhinal 
		cortex to the CA3.

	<p> Systems consolidation refers to the reorganization of memory over time across brain regions. Despite recent advancements in unravelling engrams
	and circuits essential for this process, the exact mechanisms behind engram cell dynamics and the role of associated pathways remain poorly understood.
	Here, we propose a computational model to address this knowledge gap that consists of a multi-region spiking recurrent neural network subject to
	biologically-plausible synaptic plasticity mechanisms. By coordinating the timescales of synaptic plasticity throughout the network and incorporating
	a hippocampus-thalamus-cortex circuit, our model is able to couple engram reactivations across these brain regions and thereby reproduce key dynamics
	of cortical and hippocampal engram cells along with their interdependencies. Decoupling hippocampal-thalamic-cortical activity disrupts engram dynamics
	and systems consolidation. Our modeling work also yields several testable predictions: engram cells in mediodorsal thalamus are activated in response
	to partial cues in recent and remote recall and are crucial for systems consolidation; hippocampal and thalamic engram cells are essential for coupling
	engram reactivations between subcortical and cortical regions; inhibitory engram cells have region-specific dynamics with coupled reactivations;
	inhibitory input to mediodorsal thalamus is critical for systems consolidation; and thalamocortical synaptic coupling is predictive of cortical engram
	dynamics and the retrograde amnesia pattern induced by hippocampal damage. Overall, our results suggest that systems consolidation emerges from concerted
	interactions among engram cells in distributed brain regions enabled by coordinated synaptic plasticity timescales in multisynaptic subcortical-cortical
	circuits.

	<p> High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) have been researched for over 20 years. Originally discovered in normal brain tissue, later work found they
	were more prevalent in epileptic tissue, leading to many clinical studies attempting to utilize them as epilepsy biomarkers.
	One of the primary challenges in HFO research is determining whether a recorded event represents normal or pathological neural function.
	One prevailing theory is that epileptic HFOs are predominantly caused by pyramidal cell firing, while “normal” HFOs are produced by inhibitory post
	synaptic potentials. Using a realistic computational model containing pyramidal neurons and basket cells, we determined the signal characteristics
	over a range of parameters. We found that fast ripples (HFOs > 250 Hz) could only reliably be generated by pyramidal cell firing.
	Surprisingly, these oscillations occurred even in a completely uncoupled network. We then proved mathematically that, in networks of strongly activated,
	structurally similar neurons, emergent oscillations are not only possible but expected. This result suggests that pathological HFOs may not require any
	specific network structure, but instead are simply a property of highly active neurons that have been disconnected from normal inhibitory feedback
	connections such as is commonly seen in epileptic tissue.

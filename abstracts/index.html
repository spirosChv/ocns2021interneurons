	<p> Basket cells are key GABAergic inhibitory interneurons that target the somata and proximal dendrites, enabling efficient control of the timing and rate of
    spiking of their postsynaptic targets. In all cortical circuits, there are two major types of basket cell that exhibit striking developmental, molecular,
    anatomical, and physiological differences. In this talk, I will discuss recent results that reveal the tightly coupled complementarity of these two key
    microcircuit regulatory modules, demonstrating a novel form of brain-state-specific segregation of inhibition during spontaneous behavior, with implications
    for the assessment of dysregulated inhibition in neurological disorders. In addition, we will discuss recent experimental and computational modeling insights
    from a collaborative project with the <a style="color:blue" href="https://www.losonczylab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Losonczy lab</a>
    at Columbia that predict key roles for interneurons in the selective suppression of cue-responsive cells
    during hippocampal ripples related to episodic memory replay.

	<br> <div align="justify" > <p style="font-size:22px">GABAergic interneurons comprise one of the main types of cells in the mammalian nervous system.
	They play a critical role in learning and memory processes via inhibition and disinhibition pathways. Interneurons exhibit a variety of structural,
	molecular, electrophysiological and connectivity features. This high degree of variability makes it quite challenging to delineate their role in mnemonic
	functions through current experimental approaches. Computational modeling approaches, on the other hand, are a prominent tool used to predict their
	contribution to acquisition, storage and retrieval of information. The aim of this workshop is to present the latest computational work that highlights
	the function of interneurons in learning and memory processes. Additionally, we will actively discuss the next steps on how modeling approaches, from
	single cell to network models level, would benefit future research on interneurons as pertaining to mnemonic functions.</p></h2>
